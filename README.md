The Scientific term for body fat is adipose tissue.  Adipose tissue serves severalimportant  roles  in  the  body  from  creating  energy  to  hormone  regulation  andcushioning.  The health impacts associated with body fats that are outside thehealthy range are very serious.  In addition to health impacts, it is also used inthe fitness industry to track and measure dietary progress.  The few methods ofmeasuring body fat are not generally accessible to the public.  This App aimsto make body fat prediction more accessible to the public.  This project consistsof two parts.  The first part will be using machine-learning algorithms to traina neural network on datasets gathered online.  The second part will consist ofan Android App, which will take inputs from the user such as weight, height,age and a captured image of the user.  These data will use the trained neuralnetwork to enable users to predict their body fat within a reasonable level of accuracy.
